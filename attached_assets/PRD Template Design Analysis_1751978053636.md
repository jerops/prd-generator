- Current Workarounds: Checkboxes (Manual process, Third-party tools, No solution, Other)
- Time Impact: Dropdown (Minutes, Hours, Days per task)

### Section 3: Solution Approach
**Inputs needed:**
- Platform Type: Radio buttons (Browser, Desktop, Mobile, API, Extension)
- Technology Stack: Checkboxes (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Python, Node.js, Other)
- Complexity Level: Radio buttons (Simple, Moderate, Complex)

### Section 4: Key Features
**Inputs needed:**

- Nice-to-Have Features: Dynamic list
- Explicitly Excluded: Dynamic list
- Feature Priority: Drag-and-drop ranking

### Section 5: Technical Considerations
**Inputs needed:**
- Browser Support: Checkboxes (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Mobile)
- Performance Requirements: Sliders/inputs (File size limits, Response time, Concurrent users)
- Data Handling: Checkboxes (Local processing, Cloud storage, API integration)
- Security Level: Radio buttons (Public, Internal, Sensitive, Confidential)

### Section 6: Success Criteria
**Inputs needed:**
- Success Metrics: Dynamic list with measurement units
- Definition of Done: Checklist items
- Timeline: Date picker or duration selector

## Smart Input Features

### Conditional Logic
- Show/hide sections based on project type
- Adjust questions based on complexity level
- Dynamic feature suggestions based on platform choice

### Auto-suggestions
- Common features for each project type
- Typical success metrics
- Standard technology combinations

### Validation
- Required field indicators
- Real-time validation feedback
- Completeness progress bar

## User Experience Flow

1. **Welcome Screen** - Brief intro and project type selection
2. **Guided Form** - Step-by-step sections with progress indicator
3. **Review Screen** - Preview of generated content
4. **Export Options** - Download as Markdown, PDF, or both
5. **Save/Load** - Option to save progress and return later

## UI Design Principles
